## About
* Fulgent is a display serif font with high contrast stroke. The most significant feature of it is the arch-shaped hollows at the intersections of its strokes, which enlarges the counter and aperture of alphabets,  brightening the appearance of the font.

* Fulgent is a font independently crafted by designer yidatsai; it currently contains the uppercase and lowercase English letters, numbers, and basic symbols, as well as ligatures. It is now version 1.0 and only available for English.
